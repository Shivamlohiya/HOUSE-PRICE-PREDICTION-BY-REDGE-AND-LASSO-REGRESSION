# HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTION-BY-REDGE-AND-LASSO-REGRESSION


This project applies **Ridge** and **Lasso Regression** to predict house prices based on various features such as size, number of rooms, number of bathrooms, stories and parking. It demonstrates how regularization techniques can improve model performance and reduce overfitting in linear regression.

# üìå Project Overview

Accurate house price prediction is crucial for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals. This project uses machine learning to build predictive models that estimate property prices using historical data and feature engineering.

# üöÄ Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visual insights
- Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling
- Implementation of Ridge and Lasso Regression
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Model evaluation using RMSE, R¬≤ score, and cross-validation
- Comparison of Ridge vs Lasso performance

## üß† Algorithms Used

| Algorithm       | Description                                                                |
|---------------- |----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ridge Regression| Penalizes large coefficients using L2 regularization to reduce overfitting |
| Lasso Regression| Uses L1 regularization to shrink coefficients and perform feature selection|
